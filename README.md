Ship It API and Frontend
========================

See `api` and `frontend` READMEs for more details on each.


Local Development
-----------------
Use `docker-compose up` to run them both. The API will be available at https://localhost:8015. The frontend will be available at https://localhost:8010

Deployed Environments
---------------------

We have a number of deployed Ship It environments. All of the backends respond to pushes to different Docker tags in https://hub.docker.com/r/mozilla/release-services. Each frontend has its own S3 bucket that is deployed to as part of CI on a particular branch. Below are further details about each:


Production
----------
Deploys in response to pushes to the `production` branch, if the `CloudOps Stage` deployment in successful (see below).

* Backend URL: https://shipit-api.mozilla-releng.net
* Backend Dockerhub Tag: `shipit_api_dockerflow_production`
* Taskcluster Secret: project/releng/shipit/config:production
* Taskcluster Client ID: project/releng/shipit/production
* Frontend URL: https://shipit.mozilla-releng.net/
* Frontend S3 bucket: `relengstatic-prod-shipitfrontend-static-website`
* Product Details URL: https://product-details.mozilla.org

There is also a "CloudOps Stage" environment (which is different than the "Staging" environment below) that is deployment as part of the production pipeline. When a production deployment begins, Jenkins first deploys to this environment. If that deployment succeeds, the deployment proceeds. If it fails, the deployment is aborted. The URL for this backend is https://stage.shipitapi.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net.

Staging
-------
Deploys in response to pushes to the `staging` branch.

* Backend URL: https://api.shipit.staging.mozilla-releng.net
* Backend Dockerhub Tag: `shipit_api_dockerflow_staging`
* Taskcluster Secret: project/releng/shipit/config:staging
* Taskcluster Client ID: project/releng/shipit/production (yes, the same as production)
* Frontend URL: https://shipit.staging.mozilla-releng.net/
* Frontend S3 bucket: `relengstatic-staging-shipitfrontend-static-website`
* Product Details URL: https://product-details.staging.mozilla-releng.net

Two important notes about staging:
1) The backend URL is actually a CNAME for dev.shipitapi.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net. Despite the fact that the real FQDN says "dev", we refer to this environment as "staging".
2) There is _also_ a CloudOps environment known as "stage", at stage.shipitapi.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net, which we do not use (more on that in the "CloudOps staging" section below).


Testing
-------
Deploys in response to pushes to the `testing` branch.

* Backend URL: https://testing.shipitapi.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net
* Backend Dockerhub Tag: `shipit_api_dockerflow_testing`
* Taskcluster Secret: project/releng/shipit/config:testing
* Taskcluster Client ID: project/releng/shipit/dev
* Frontend URL: https://shipit.testing.mozilla-releng.net/
* Frontend S3 bucket: `relengstatic-testing-shipitfrontend-static-website`
* Product Details URL: https://product-details.testing.mozilla-releng.net
